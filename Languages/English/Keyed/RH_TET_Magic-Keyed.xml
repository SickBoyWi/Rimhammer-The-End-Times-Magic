	<RH_TET_Magic_UseMiscastsInfo>Allow magic using pawns to suffer miscasts as was done in Warhammer Lore. Turn this off if you want pawns to not miscast, say for instance if you are doing a non-Warhammer themed game. On a related note, and in the latter case, you should get my Any One Can Magic mod, as it'll make the magic lores available to all pawns in the game, not just specific pawns configured in the Rimhammer - The End Times faction mods.</RH_TET_Magic_UseMiscastsInfo>
